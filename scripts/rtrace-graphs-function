# CHANGES
#
# 2010-08-02
# - Updated to support rtrace format and moved to sp-rtrace pacakge.
# 2010-09-10
# - Update help and calltree options
# - If destination file is older than source file, re-create it
# - If files are already generated, don't check for / complain
#  about tools needed to generate them
# 2010-11-03
# - Rewrite to handle both binary & text traces and whether they're
#   already processed or not.

$name generates graphs of resource allocation backtraces
going through the functions with given name prefix in all the given trace
files.  The graphs are saved to a subdirectory with a same name.

Good values for <limit> are 0.1 - 5, depending on the trace file contents.

To re-generate the graphs (with new limit), just remove the directory.
