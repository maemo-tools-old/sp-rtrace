sp-rtrace test suite

By default the testsuite is compiled and executed with make check.
To allow easier testing on embeded devices it's possible to separate
compile and test process with the following environment variables:
  RT_DISABLE_COMPILE - set to 1 to disable compilation 
  RT_DISABLE_TEST - set to 1 to disable test execution.
