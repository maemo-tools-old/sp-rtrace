sp-rtrace test suite

By default the testsuite is compiled and executed with make check.
To allow easier testing on embeded devices it's possible to separate
compile and test process with the following environment variables:
  RT_DISABLE_COMPILE - set to 1 to disable compilation 
  RT_DISABLE_TEST - set to 1 to disable test execution.
  
The test suite requires dejagnu package.
  

Running tests on a device:
1) Compile the package: dpkg-buildpackge -rfakeroot -b 
2) Compile test applications by executing RT_DISABLE_TEST=1 make check
   in tests directory
3) Copy the test directory to device.
4) Increse max pty count on device: echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/pty/max
5) Run testsuite by executing RT_DISABLE_COMPILE=1 runtest --tool=sp-rtrace
