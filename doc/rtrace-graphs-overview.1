.TH RTRACE-GRAPHS-OVERVIEW 1 "2010-08-03" "sp-rtrace"
.SH NAME
rtrace-graphs-overview - create overview graphs of rtrace reports
.SH SYNOPSIS
rtrace-graphs-overview
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIrtrace-graphs-overview\fP automatically resolves addresses in all
rtrace reports in the current directory (if corresponding
binaries and libraries contain debug symbols) with \fIsp-rtrace-resolve\fP,
generates overview graph description files for them with \fIrtrace-calltree\fP
and finally creates graphs from those with \fIdot\fP (part of GraphViz).
.PP
\fIrtrace-graphs-overview\fP gives \fIrtrace-calltree\fP options which should
create reasonable graphs even for very complicated programs.  If you
want to see more details, use either \fIrtrace-graphs-function\fP or
just call \fIrtrace-calltree\fP (and \fIdot\fP) with options suitably
modified from the ones (shown to be) used by this script.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B *.resolved
Rtrace reports resolved with \fsp-rtrace-resolve\fP from the
original .trace files.
.TP
.B *.dot
Graph description files generated by \fIrtrace-calltree\fP from the trace
files.
.TP
.B *.ps
The (PostScript) graph files generated by \fIdot\fP from the .dot
files.
.PP
To recreate the graphs, just remove the appropriate files (listed
above) and re-run the \fIrtrace-graphs-overview\fP script.
