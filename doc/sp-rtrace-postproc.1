.SH NAME
sp-rtrace-postproc - resource consumption trace data processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
sp-rtrace-postproc \fI<options>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
sp-rtrace-postproc is a resource consumption trace data post-processor.
It accepts binary data generated by the pre-processor, text data
written by it itself or by the resolver, applies the specified
post-processing options on that and generates text format output.
.SS Options:
.TP 
 \fI--help\fP (\fI-h\fP)
Displays help information and exits.
.TP
\fI--output-dir\fP=<path> (\fI-o\fP <path)
Specifies the output directory for storing processed trace data. 

By default the data is written to the standard output.

.TP
\fI--input-file\fP=<path> (\fI-i\fP <path>)
Specifies the input file.

By default the data is read from the standard input.
.TP
\fI--format\fP=text|binary (\fI-f\fP text|binary)
Specifies the input data format.

By default the binary data is expected.
.TP
\fI--filter-leaks\fP (\fI-l\fP)
Filters leaked resources by removing allocations of the resources that
are freed afterwards. The deallocation call records are also removed.
This option leaves only leaked (non-freed) resource allocations in trace
file.
.TP
\fI--compress\fP (\fI-c\fP)
Compresses trace data by grouping function calls with the same backtraces.
In combination with \fI--filter-leaks\fP option it gives better view of 
the leak sources by combining leaked resources with the same origins.
.TP
\fI--resolve\fP (\fI-r\fP)
Resolves backtrace addresses by starting sp-rtrace-resolve process and
redirecting output to it. If --output-dir option is set, post-processor
generates appropriate output file name and passes it to the resolver with 
-o option. Otherwise the resolved data will be written to standard output.
.TP
\fI--context\fP <context> (\fI-C\fP <context>)
Filters out function call records not matching the specified context mask.
.TP
\fI--sort\fP <order> (\fI-s\fP <order>)
Sets the backtrace sorting order for --compress and --filter-leaks 
options. Where <order> can be:
  size      - sort by a total leak size of a backtrace
              in descending order.  
  size-asc  - sort by a total leak size of a backtrace 
              in ascending order.
  count     - sort by a total leak count of a backtrace 
              in descending order.
  count-asc - sort by a total leak count of a backtrace
              in ascending order.

By default the backtraces are sorted by a total leak size 
in descending order.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
sp-rtrace-postproc -i rtrace-raw-2535 > rtrace-text
Convert the binary data file rtrace-raw-2535 into text format and write
the result into rtrace-text.
.TP
sp-rtrace-postproc -i rtrace-text -l -f text > rtrace-text-leaks
Filter leaks from the text data in rtrace-text and store the result into
rtrace-text-leaks file.
.TP
sp-rtrace-postproc -i rtrace-text-leaks -c -r -f text > rtrace-text-resolved
Compress backtraces, resolve addresses and store the result into
rtrace-text-resolved file.
