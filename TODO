Potential TODOs

* Make "-f" option to toggle also whether sub-processes
  are traced (= whether LD_PRELOAD is set)?

* Add -M option support to sp-rtrace-postproc too, so that
  one can easily analyze where the given sized allocations
  (showing in the histogram) originate from.

* In file module, support recvmsg() for a socket which passes
  array of file descriptors from another process (behavior
  for them is like for dup(2)).

* Expand memtransfer module to cover more functions and
  test that it actually gives reasonable results (things
  going through PLT cover enough of such function calls
  to tell something relevant about memory reads & writes)
  as many such operations are done within libc itself or
  inlined (when size is known at build time).
